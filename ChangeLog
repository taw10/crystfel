CrystFEL version 0.5.0, 19th April 2013
---------------------------------------

- The internal architecture has been changed to accommodate multiple crystals
  per diffraction pattern.
- The stream format has changed as a result of the above.
- The indexing logic has reworked to make it easier to control what information
  is used for indexing and to allow the user to try more indexing options in
  turn.
- Saturated peaks and integrated reflections are now counted and the number
  included in the stream.
- GrainSpotter indexing has been added.
- XDS indexing has been added.
- The "--nshells" argument was added to check_hkl.
- The "--median-filter" argument was added to indexamajig and hdfsee.

  options which will be passed through to hdfsee.

  pattern_sim (Chun Hong Yoon).

  stream.


CrystFEL version 0.4.3, 10th January 2013
-----------------------------------------

- compare_hkl was reworked to simplify the available figures of merit, add CC*,
  and to be consistent between the overall and resolution shell values.  A new
  option, --intensity-shells, was also added.
- Unit cells can now be handled in any setting.
- Indexamajig will now examine the unit cell given on the command line, even if
  the final cell will not be checked (i.e. if --cell-reduction=none).  The
  lattice type will then be given to MOSFLM, which can help a lot in finding the
  right solution.
- Indexamajig now records the number of saturated reflections in the stream.
- Indexamajig now processes the peaks obtained using "--peaks=hdf5" to check for
  bad detector regions, peaks too close to panel edges, etc.
- New options "--integrate-saturated", "--use-saturated" and "--integrate-found"
  were added to indexamajig.
- A bug was fixed which caused systematically absent (due to centering)
  reflections to be predicted and integrated.
- The colour scaling in hdfsee was improved.
- powder_plot was moved to the extra programs repository.
- The configure script now checks for HDF5.
- Forbidden (due to centering) reflections are now taken into account by
  check_hkl when calculating the completeness.

  avoiding an unnecessary iteration.

  and so on.
- The new option "--min-measurements" was added to process_hkl.
- The wavelength can now be specified in the beam file as an HDF5 path or as an
  explicit number, just like the camera length.  There is no longer any
  "fallback" to a nominal value (Chun Hong Yoon).


CrystFEL version 0.4.2, 2nd October 2012
----------------------------------------

- A data quality regression, introduced between versions 0.3.0 and 0.4.0, was
  fixed.

  regression, was also fixed (approximately a factor of 2 speed increase with
  indexamajig).
